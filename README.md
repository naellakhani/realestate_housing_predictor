Real Estate Housing Price Predictor: Python-based program for property price forecasting

Overview: Program is designed to forecast property prices utilizing a real estate dataset and involves data 
preprocessing steps including data cleaning, feature scaling, outlier removal and one-hot encoding. Data is 
visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn for outlier detection (smaller square footage rooms having higher prices).
Employs scikit-learn to perform linear regression analysis to build a predictive machine learning model which was reinforced by k-fold cross validation.
Paramters used to predict housing prices: location, size and # of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Libraries used: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.
